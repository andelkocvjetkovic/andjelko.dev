I currently work as a Front-end Developer at Codepool. 
I'm a developer who loves to code on the web using my favorite language TypeScript in combination with React.
Currently learning how to minimize side effects and how to write pure functions(a big fan of functional programming), also a big fan of Neovim, I'm using it for almost 2 years.



## Experience

### Frontend Developer at Codepool

***06.2021 - Still going*** 

I started as a Junior Frontend Developer and, after one year, was promoted to a Mid-level Frontend Developer.
I've worked on several projects, but I'll highlight the most notable ones.


My first project was a [Villa Hana in Croatia](https://villahana-croatia.com/), I got [a web site](https://villa-hana.vercel.app/) which was really slow, it was bought from wordpress theme market and it was really bad.
I've transformed it into really fast and responsive web site, I've used Next.js and Bootstrap for the project.
Also I have connected it with Strapi CMS and created a custom CMS for the client. 
However, there was an interesting challenge: we used [render.com](https://render.com/) to host our Strapi CMS. Unfortunately, I hadn't created a backup for the CMS, and one day render.com restarted their servers, leading to the loss of all data. Explaining the loss of all the photos to the scrum master was a daunting task.


Next project is a [Shidou](https://app.shidou.io), I've been working on this project for 2 years.
It's a platform for project managment, it relies on SCRUM methodology, and tries to streamline users how to use SCRUM the right way.
I've been working on the front-end part of the project. I've created all the pages, components, connected it to the back-end and was involved in creating a design system for the project.
Project is really big, I've to created a landing page(Next.js), App(SPA React), and a monitoring dashboard for root users(SPA React). 
I've used several build tools, like Vite and Next.js within a monorepo, and created a CSS library for the project. 
It'll e released soon, but if you want to see it in action, send me an [andjelko.cvjetkovic@gmail.com](mailto:andjelko.cvjetkovic@gmail.com) and I'll send you an invitation.


My last recent project was a one page web site for [Alj enterprise](https://alj-web.vercel.app/en), project is still under development, so I'll update this when it is finished.
