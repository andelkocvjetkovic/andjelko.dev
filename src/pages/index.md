I currently work as a Frontend Developer at Codepool. 
I am a developer who loves to code on the web using my favorite language TypeScript in combination with React.
Currently learning how to minimize side effects and how to write pure functions(a big fan of functional programming).
Also I am a big fan of Neovim, I am using it for almost 2 years.



## Experience

### Frontend Developer at Codepool

***06.2021 - Still going*** 

I started as a Junior Frontend Developer and, after one year, was promoted to a Mid-level Frontend Developer.
I have worked on several projects, but I'll highlight the most notable ones.


My first project was a [Villa in Croatia](https://villahana-croatia.com/), I got web site which was really slow, it was bought from wordpress theme market and it was really bad.
I have transformed it into really fast and responsive web site, I have used Next.js and TailwindCSS. 
Also I have connected it with Strapi CMS and created a custom CMS for the client. 
However, there was an interesting challenge: we used render.io to host our Strapi CMS. Unfortunately, I hadn't created a backup for the CMS, and one day render.io deleted our instance, leading to the loss of all data. Explaining the loss of all the photos to the client was a daunting task.


Next project is a [Shidou](https://app.shidou.io), I have been working on this project for 2 years.
It is a platform for project managment, it relies on SCRUM methodology, and tries to streamline the process of project managment.
I have been working on the frontend part of the project, I have created all the components, and I have created a custom design system for the project,
Project is really big, I have to created a landing page, App, and monitoring dashboard for root users. 
I have used several build tools, like Vite and Next.js and created a CSS library for the project. 
It soons will be released, but if you want to see it in action, send me an [andjelko.cvjetkovic@gmail.com](mailto:andjelko.cvjetkovic@gmail.com) and I will send you an invitation.


My last recent project was a one page web site for [ALJ-ENTERPRISE](https://alj-web.vercel.app/en), project is still under development, so I'll update this when it is finished.
